- 👋 Hi, I’m @happphi
- 👀 I’m interested in coding an CS in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning an introduction course called CS50 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that fits my current level, so that bascically means getting coffee for you and me asking for support for now!
Motivated to prove my worth along the way. In the meantime, contact me for work opportunities and anything that has to do with labour in EU and HR 
(being an international Sr. HR Consultant) 
📫 How to reach me via @happphi, many thx!
